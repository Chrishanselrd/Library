#Library
This program is designed to help libraries manage their collections and patrons efficiently. The program is able to read in information about patrons, books, and commands, and store them in data structures such as binary search trees and hash tables.

The program also utilizes inheritance and polymorphism, allowing for efficient and flexible management of different types of items such as books and actions. Factories are used to create these items, enabling the program to create books and actions on demand as needed.

The program includes a variety of functions, such as allowing patrons to check out and return books, displaying the history of patrons, and listing all the books and patrons in the system. These functions are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
